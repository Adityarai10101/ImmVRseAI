This is ImmVRse, the future of Virtual Reality on the Solana Blockchain. We create an easy on-ramp into the amazing world of virtual reality, while providing a way to make the metaverse ever so slightly more "real".

We used the PIFuHD model (credit: facebook) and BackgroundRemover (credit to the creator of https://backgroundremover.app for all code related to that as well as the API itself) in order to create a system where images can be turned into masks of the people inside of them, and these masks (along with the initial images) can be used to generate a 3D model of the person. This model was then fed into MeshLab, where a series of scripts (not included in the Github) were used to convert the formats outputted by the PIFuHD model into a format that could be read by Unity, our choice for a VR development tool. We then fed these models into Unity, and used Web3.storage (a filecoin project) to store all these assets on the IPFS storage network. Finally, we plugged the CID's into various document formats (PDF's and PNG's for 2D views of the model) and turned these into a NFT through the Solana CLI. We then did this process for all four of us to create an NFT Metaverse avatar for ourselves in our own phantom wallets.
